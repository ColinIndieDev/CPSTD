# CP Header Collection

## About
This is my collection of libraries / header files I made (except CPL & CPLT or CPAI) entirely in C.
Most of the stuff I wrote before is C++ so I also try to convert it as well into C

## Projects

- CPSTD:
- my standard library, the standard itself is also partly seperated by submodules you can choose from
- - CPMath:
  - includes mat and some linear algebra functions
- - CPRNG:
  - generate random numbers with PCG
- - others:
  - there are smaller submodules for data structures like vectors, arrays, pairs etc.

- CPA:
- a synthesizer you can write to compose music by passing a vector of notes indicating frequency in Hz and duration in s which are written in .wav files

- CPLT:
- draw with ASCII characters stuff into the terminal and features to make simple games with it running inside the terminal interface

- CPAI:
- library for neural networks you can create like a digit recognition AI

- CPL:
- a graphics/game library which you can make every possible game by using OpenGL by giving helpful features but keeping the user the freedom to implement their own functionalities for their needs
