# CPSTD
## About
This is my collection of libraries / header files I made (except CPL & CPLT or CPAI) entirely in C.

## Projects
- CPSTD & CPM (CPStandard + CPMath)
> a standard library for data strucutres or functions
> f.e. vectors (dynamic arrays), pairs, matrices & vectors or math functions (sin, cos, powf etc.)

- CPA (CPAudio)
> a synthesizer you can write to compose music by passing a vector of notes indicating frequency in Hz
> and duration in s which are written in .wav files

## Future projects
- CPLT (move to this repo instead of seperate one)
- CPAI (rewrite in C instead of C++)
- and more!
